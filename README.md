---------------------------

I was born in 1993 at Ordu. When I was 13 my curiosity of controlling a lot of devices led me to study Information Technologies at High School and after that I interested in electronical things. I enrolled to Electrical and Electronics Engineering in University. I have enjoyed so much at my Bachelor degree. With my graduation I decided to improve my programming skills about software, AI and VR. Programming is not just my job. It is my life style.
